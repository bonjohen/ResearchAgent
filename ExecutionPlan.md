# Research Agent Execution Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step approach to implement the Research Agent based on the requirements. The plan is organized into phases with clear deliverables for each phase.

## Chain of Thought Analysis

To implement the Research Agent effectively, we need to:

1. Set up the development environment and project structure
2. Implement the core agent architecture
3. Add support for local models via Ollama
4. Integrate web search capabilities
5. Implement the report generation functionality
6. Add vector database support for RAG operations
7. Create Windows scripts for easy setup and usage
8. Implement comprehensive testing
9. Create documentation

The dependencies between these components suggest the following execution order:
- Environment setup must come first
- Core agent architecture provides the foundation for all other components
- Local model support and web search can be developed in parallel
- Report generation depends on having search results
