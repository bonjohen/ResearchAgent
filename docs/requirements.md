# Research Agent Requirements

This document outlines the requirements for the Research Agent project, including both the original requirements and additional features that have been implemented.

## Core Requirements

### Phase 1: Basic Research Pipeline
- [x] Command-line interface for research queries
- [x] Basic web search functionality
- [x] Simple report generation
- [x] External storage for research data

### Phase 2: Agent Architecture
- [x] Multi-agent architecture with planning, search, and writer agents
- [x] Agent registry for managing different agent types
- [x] Agent pipeline for sequential processing
- [x] Parallel agent execution for improved performance

### Phase 3: OpenAI Integration
- [x] OpenAI model provider implementation
- [x] Function calling capabilities
- [x] Support for different OpenAI models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4)
- [x] Environment variable configuration for API keys

### Phase 4: Web Search Enhancement
- [x] Support for multiple search providers:
  - [x] DuckDuckGo (no API key required)
  - [x] Google Custom Search (with API key)
  - [x] Serper API (with API key)
  - [x] Tavily API (with API key)
- [x] Web content fetching and processing
- [x] Fallback mechanisms for search providers
- [x] Simulated search results when real results are unavailable

### Phase 5: Local Model Integration
- [x] Ollama model provider implementation
- [x] Support for local models (Llama3, Mistral, etc.)
- [x] Function calling for local models via prompt engineering
- [x] Setup scripts for Ollama

### Phase 6: User Interface
- [x] Web-based user interface
- [x] Real-time progress tracking
- [x] Report viewing and management
- [x] Active task monitoring

## Additional Implemented Features

### Enhanced Research Capabilities
- [x] Iterative research with automatic follow-up on generated questions
- [x] Follow-up question generation for continued research
- [x] External file storage for data persistence outside the project folder

### User Experience Improvements
- [x] Multiple interface options (CLI and web)
- [x] Detailed progress reporting
- [x] Markdown formatting for reports
- [x] Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Development and Testing
- [x] Comprehensive test suite including unit tests
- [x] Web UI testing with Selenium
- [x] Specific tests for critical functionality (e.g., follow-up button)
- [x] Robust error handling throughout the application

### Configuration and Deployment
- [x] Environment variable management
- [x] Flexible configuration options
- [x] Easy setup scripts for Windows
- [x] Detailed documentation
