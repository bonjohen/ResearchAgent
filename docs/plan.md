# Research Agent Development Plan

This document outlines the development plan for the Research Agent project, including both the original planned phases and additional features that have been implemented.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Research Pipeline (Completed)
- [x] Set up project structure and environment
- [x] Implement basic command-line interface

- [x] Develop basic report generation
- [x] Implement external storage for research data

### Phase 2: Agent Architecture (Completed)
- [x] Design and implement BaseAgent class
- [x] Create AgentRegistry for managing different agent types
- [x] Implement AgentPipeline for sequential processing
- [x] Develop ParallelAgents for concurrent execution
- [x] Create specialized agents:
  - [x] PlanningAgent for research planning
  - [x] SearchAgent for web search execution
  - [x] WriterAgent for report generation
- [x] Implement ResearchManager to coordinate the research process

### Phase 3: OpenAI Integration (Completed)
- [x] Design ModelProvider interface
- [x] Implement OpenAIModelProvider
- [x] Add function calling capabilities
- [x] Create model factory for easy provider creation
- [x] Add support for different OpenAI models
- [x] Implement environment variable configuration

### Phase 4: Web Search Enhancement (Completed)
- [x] Implement real web search functionality
- [x] Add support for multiple search providers:
  - [x] DuckDuckGo (no API key required)
  - [x] Google Custom Search (with API key)
  - [x] Serper API (with API key)
  - [x] Tavily API (with API key)
- [x] Develop web content fetching and processing
- [x] Create fallback mechanisms for search providers
- [x] Implement simulated search results for when real results are unavailable

### Phase 5: Local Model Integration (Completed)
- [x] Design and implement OllamaModelProvider
- [x] Add support for local models (Llama3, Mistral, etc.)
- [x] Implement function calling for local models via prompt engineering
- [x] Create setup scripts for Ollama
- [x] Update model factory to include Ollama provider
- [x] Add command-line options for model selection

### Phase 6: User Interface (Completed)
- [x] Design and implement web-based user interface using Flask
- [x] Create real-time progress tracking
- [x] Implement report viewing and management
- [x] Develop active task monitoring
- [x] Add responsive design for different devices
- [x] Create API endpoints for frontend communication

## Additional Implemented Features

### Iterative Research Capabilities
- [x] Implement follow-up research based on generated questions
- [x] Create API endpoint for follow-up research
- [x] Add UI components for follow-up research
- [x] Develop background task handling for follow-up research

### Enhanced Storage
- [x] Implement external file storage outside the project folder
- [x] Create migration script for moving data to new location
- [x] Add configurable storage paths via environment variables

### Improved Testing
- [x] Develop comprehensive test suite
